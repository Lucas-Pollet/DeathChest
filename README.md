# DeathChest

DeathChest is a plugin for Bukkit that will create a chest with all drops when you die.
It's fully customizable:

- Change maximum amounts of death chests
- Change message (e.g change colors or translate them)
- Make death chests protectable, which means only the owner can access to the chest
- and more...

### Current version
1.0
### Todo's

 - Add permission node to bypass protection
 - Make it compatible with Java 7
 - Have any ideas? [Go here](https://github.com/KaskadekingDE/DeathChest/issues/new "New Issue - DeathChest") to create a new issue :)

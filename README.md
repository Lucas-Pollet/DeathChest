# DeathChest

DeathChest will create a chest with all your drops when you die.

It can be used for e.g SurvivalGames or other Minigames.

It's fully customizable:

- Change maximum amounts of death chests

- Change message (e.g change colors or translate them)

- Make death chests protectable, which means only the owner can access to the chest

- and more...

### Permissions

```
deathchest.help - Allows user to access to the /dc help command

deathchest.reload - Allows user to reload the config

deathchest.place - Allows user to place a death chest.

deathchest.kill.place - If player kills another player a chest will be spawned without that the victim needs to have a permission.

deathchest.protection.bypass - Allows user to bypass death chest protection

deathchest.home - Allows user to set their home chest with /dc home

deathchest.locations - Allows user to see his chest locations

deathchest.locations.other - Allows user to see the chest locations of other players

deathchest.remove - Allows user to remove one of his chests

deathchest.remove.other - Allows user to remove chests of other players
```

### Known Issues:

- Timer to remove death chests after specific timespan will be cancelled on reload/stop.

### Current version
1.7
### Todo's

 - ~~Add permission node to bypass protection~~
 
 - ~~Make it compatible with Java 7~~
 
 - ~~Added whitelist for blocks~~
